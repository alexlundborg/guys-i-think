        <p>"...I think we <i>might</i> be able to get it back."</p>

        <p>Sarai stood at the whiteboard, marker still in hand, her other hand frozen mid-gesture like she'd forgotten it was there. "The corruption. It's not degradation, it's—Chen, pull up the emission curve from the supergiant. The full two hundred years."</p>

        <p>Chen set down his coffee. "Which band?"</p>

        <p>"All of them. Overlay them."</p>

        <p>Chen pulled it up on his laptop, the familiar interface they all used for this kind of work—nothing fancy, nothing that could fail in interesting ways. Marcus leaned forward, glasses sliding down his nose. "Oh, you're kidding me."</p>

        <p>"It's inverse," Sarai said, and her voice had gone quiet in that way it did when she was either completely wrong or completely right. "Look at the decay pattern in the key—it's not random. It's the <em>inverse</em> of the stellar output curve. The radiation didn't just damage it, it transformed it. We have the transformation."</p>

        <p>"So we reverse it," Chen said slowly. Then, faster: "We reverse it. We have the measurements. Sarai, we have <em>all</em> the measurements."</p>

        <p>"If the model holds," Marcus said. He was cleaning his glasses now, compulsive. "If we're right about the emission mechanism. If there aren't secondary interactions we haven't—"</p>

        <p>"There's always something we haven't accounted for," Sarai interrupted. "But we've been tracking that star for two centuries <em>because</em> our predecessors knew to care about this stuff. They gave us this. The data's clean."</p>

        <p>Chen was already running simulations on his laptop. "Okay. Okay, if this works, we get the oracle back online. If it fails halfway through..." He stopped.</p>

        <p>"If it fails, we burn an attempt," Marcus said. "And we've only got so many before lockout kicks in."</p>

        <p>The room went quiet. Through the window, both moons hung in the afternoon sky, one a thin crescent, one nearly full. Somewhere out there, forty-three light-years away, a dying star was still screaming radiation into the void, utterly indifferent to what it had broken here.</p>

        <p>"We don't have a choice," Sarai said. "Core MINERVA is red. The council meets in three weeks to decide on global lockdown. Once that starts, we lose access to the vault entirely."</p>

        <p>"Two and a half weeks," Chen said quietly. "Possibly less if the Plan B team pushes for an early vote."</p>

        <p>Dr. Kim arrived without fanfare, just the <em>snick</em> of the door and the shuffle of his shoes. He was seventy-eight and still arrived before everyone else most mornings. Now he stood in front of the whiteboard, reading Sarai's equations with his head tilted like he was listening to music.</p>

        <p>"The inverse transform," he said after a moment. It wasn't a question.</p>

        <p>"Yes," Sarai said.</p>

        <p>He nodded once, then turned to Chen's laptop. Watched the simulations cycle through iteration after iteration. "The stellar data will hold," he said. "I calibrated those sensors myself, back when I had better knees. They're good."</p>

        <p>"It's still a gamble," Marcus said.</p>

        <p>"Everything is." Dr. Kim pulled up a chair, settling in with the particular solidity of someone who'd made hard decisions before. "But it's a good gamble. Better than letting the council vote for global lockdown because we didn't try." He looked at each of them in turn. "You're sure about the emission curve correlation?"</p>

        <p>"Ninety-three percent confidence," Chen said. "With the full dataset."</p>

        <p>Dr. Kim smiled faintly. "Our predecessors were very thorough people." He stood, moved to the whiteboard, picked up a marker. "Show me your error bounds. Let's see if we can get this right on the first try."</p>

        <p>Outside, the twin moons continued their slow dance. Inside, the work began.</p>
