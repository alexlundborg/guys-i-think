    </section>

    <section class="narrative" id="part1">
        <p>"I can recover it."</p>

        <p>Sarai's hand hovers at the whiteboard, the marker trembling slightly. The equation she's just written—a cascade of tensor operations folded into recursive error-correction matrices—sits there like something unearthed. Chen's coffee cup stops halfway to his mouth. Through the dome's triple-paned silicate, the twin moons hang motionless, one rust-colored, one pale as bone.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"The radiation didn't just corrupt the key," she says, turning. Her eyes have that wide, almost frightened look of someone watching dominoes fall in their mind. "It introduced a pattern. Chaotic, yes, but not random. There's a—" She circles three variables on the board. "The decay follows the inverse of the stellar emission curve. We have <em>those</em> measurements. We've had them for two hundred years."</p>

        <p>Marcus removes his glasses, polishes them on his sleeve—a nervous habit from when he still needed them—and puts them back on. <span class="dialogue">"You're saying the damage itself is the map."</span> His voice is careful, the way you'd touch something that might shatter.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"Not a map. A shadow."</span> Sarai's marker squeaks against the board, sketching waveforms that intersect and diverge. <span class="dialogue">"If we can model the particle stream's precise trajectory, the quantum decoherence pattern becomes invertible. Theoretically."</span> That last word costs her something. They all know what happened the last time someone said <em>theoretically</em> about the encryption. What was lost. What was unleashed. Why they encrypt at all.</p>

        <p>The silence that follows isn't doubt. It's the sensation of standing at a cliff's edge, looking down at the only path forward. Beneath the research facility, in shielded vaults three hundred meters down, the corrupted archive waits. Eleven thousand years of accumulated understanding, locked behind mathematics that was supposed to be eternal. Chen sets down his cup. It doesn't make a sound.</p>

    <section class="narrative" id="part2">
        <p>Dr. Kim Jae-won's footsteps are soft against the polished stone floor, but they all turn. He's wearing the gray cardigan he favors during the night shifts, hands tucked into its pockets. His eyes go to the whiteboard first—they always do—and he reads the equations the way some people read poetry. His head tilts. The corner of his mouth lifts.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"You found the invariant,"</span> he says. Not a question. He steps closer, one finger tracing the air near Sarai's tensor cascade without quite touching the board. <span class="dialogue">"Elegant. And dangerous."</span> The word sits there between them. He's older than any of them by decades, old enough to have studied under someone who studied under someone who remembered the Before Times. Who knew why they started encrypting in the first place.</p>

        <p>Marcus has put his thick-framed glasses back on, is already pulling up stellar data on his tablet. Chen is running preliminary simulations, fingers dancing across haptic interfaces. Sarai hasn't moved from the whiteboard. <span class="dialogue">"The error margins are..."</span> she begins.</p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">"Narrow,"</span> Kim finishes. <span class="dialogue">"They would have to be."</span> He looks at each of them in turn, and something passes across his face—not quite pride, not quite sorrow. <span class="dialogue">"You understand what you're proposing. The cascade risk if the reconstruction is incomplete. But also—"</span> He gestures toward the window, toward the moons and the darkness between stars. <span class="dialogue">"Also what we lose if we don't try."</span></p>

        <p>The twin moons continue their ancient rotation. Somewhere in the vault below, information that predates their civilization's first cities waits in its corrupted state, neither accessible nor quite lost. In the reflection on the dome's inner surface, five figures gather around a whiteboard covered in mathematics that might—<em>might</em>—be salvation. The night shift has four more hours. They're all still standing.</p>
